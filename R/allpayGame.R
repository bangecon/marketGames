##' Tabulates and assigns points for the results of a simple in-class entry and exit game using random values.

##' @details \code{allpayGame} tabulates the results of a simple lobbying game based on a modified version of Goeree and Holt (1999). By default students receive an "endowment" of "extra credit" points (default is 5) at the beginning of a round of bidding. In one iteration, students "bid" on a monopoly license "prize" that is (default is 4 points) by making an anonymous number of "contributions" to politicians in order to influence the decision by the government. Each contribution costs 1 point, and is tabulated as the number of times a student submits the Google Form. The winner of the auction is determined by a lottery from a random row sampled from the responses.
##'
##' @param sheet  (required) is a character string url corresponding to the Google Sheets location containing the individual submissions.
##' @param endowment is the size of the initial endowment of points the instructor wishes to give each student.
##' @param prize is the value of the license or prize each interest group (student) is bidding on.
##' @return \code{type} returns the type of activity (allpayGame).
##' @return \code{results} returns the original submissions (with market prices and points per round added).
##' @return \code{winner} returns the name of the winner and the size of the prize.
##' @return \code{grades} returns the aggregated points "won" by each student for the entire activity.
